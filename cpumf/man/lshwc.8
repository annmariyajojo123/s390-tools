.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*c command extracts complete counter sets from the CPU
Measurement Facilities for Linux on Z.
Counter sets can be specified and extracted for individual CPUs.
The output is a comma-separated values file.
Each line starts with a timestamp and the CPU number,
followed by the extracted counter values.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Displays help information, then exits.
.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Displays version information, then exits.
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-allcpu
Displays counter values from each CPU.
The default is a total summary line of all counters from all CPUs.
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-interval \fI\ seconds\fP
Specifies a time interval, in seconds,
that the command waits between read operations.
The default is 60 seconds.
.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-loop \fI\ count\fP
Performs the specified number of read operations.
.
.TP
.BR \-H ", " \-\-hide
Do not display values of undefined counters.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-short
Displays counter names as short names in the heading.
A short name consists of
a letter for the counter set followed by a number.
For example,
this flag displays counter number 0 in the basic counter
set as
.B B0
instead of
.BR Cycles .
Valid counter set letters are:
.RS
.IP B
Basic counter set
.IP P
Problem state counter set
.IP C
Crypto counter set
.IP E
Extended counter set
.IP M
MT-Diagnostic counter set
.IP U
Undefined counter.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-x ", " \-\-hex
Displays counter values as hexadecimal values.
.
.TP
.BR \-X ", " \-\-hex0x
Displays counter values as hexadecimal values with a leading 0x prefix.
.
.TP
\fR[\fIcpulist\fR][:\fIsets\fR]\fP
A comma-separated list of CPUs.
Each CPU can optionally be followed by characters that specify the counter set.
See below for details.
.
.SS "CPU List and counter-set specification"
In the comma-separated list of CPUs,
each element is a CPU or a range of CPUs.
By default, \*c lists all CPUs.
.P
The CPU list can be followed by an optional list
of characters that specify the counter sets to be extracted,
preceded by a colon.
The characters can be upper or lower case.
By default, all counter sets are used.
.IP b
Include the basic counter set.
.IP c
Include the crypto counter set.
.IP e
Include the extended counter set.
.IP m
Include the MT_Diagnostic counter set.
.IP p|u
Include the problem counter set.
.IP a
Include all known counter sets (default).
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The first example enables the basic and problem counter sets on CPU 0 and 1.
Two read operations are performed and a summary line is printed for each
read operation.
