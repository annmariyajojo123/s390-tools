.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Use \fBzcryptstats\fP to display usage statistics of IBM Crypto Express
adapters.
.PP
\fBzcryptstats\fP obtains cryptographic performance measurement data
periodically and displays the data for each cryptographic device for each
interval.
A cryptographic device can be either a card device or a queue device (APQN).
\fBzcryptstats\fP runs forever unless you limit the number of intervals with
the \fB\-\-count\fP option. The default interval time is 10 seconds.
Use the \fB\-\-interval\fP option to specify a different interval time.
.PP
By default, all available cryptographic devices are monitored.
You can optionally specify the device IDs of the devices to be monitored.
The card device representation and the queue device are both in hexadecimal
notation.
.PP
Use the \fB\-\-no\-apqn\fP option to omit the performance measurement data of
the queues. If the system does not support obtaining cryptographic
performance measurement data on the queue devices, only the card devices
are monitored.
.PP
For each device, a set of counters is displayed. The amount and meaning of the
counters are dependent on the device type and mode, see the COUNTERS section.
For each counter and interval, the following values are displayed:
.RS 2
.IP "\(bu" 2
Number of measured operations.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Rate of the measured operation in operations per second.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Utilization of the device in percent.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Average duration of the operations.
.RE
.PP
The sum of all operations is displayed in a separate \fBtotals\fP line.
Use the \fB\-\-only\-totals\fP option to omit the individual counters and
display the totals only. Use the \fB\-\-no\-totals\fP option to omit the
totals.
.PP

.B Note:
The utilization value of a counter can exceed 100%. This value is caused by
the parallel execution of cryptographic operations.
.PP
Cryptographic performance measurement data might not be available when Linux
is running as guest under z/VM or under KVM. \fBzcryptstats\fP then displays an
error message and exits.
.PP
.B Note:
\fBzcryptstats\fP utilizes the device node \fB/dev/chsc\fP. When this device
node is not available, you might have to load kernel module \fBchsc_sch\fP using
\fBmodprobe chsc_sch\fP to make it available.

.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BR DEVICE_ID
Specifies a cryptographic device for which statistics are displayed.
A device ID can either be a card device ID
(\fI<card\-id>\fP) or a queue device (APQN) ID (\fI<card\-id>.<domain\-id>\fP).
To filter all devices by domain,  provide \fI.<domain\-id>\fP.
If no IDs are given, statistics are displayed for all available devices.
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-interval\~\fIINTERVAL\fP
Specifies the interval time in seconds. If this option is omitted, then the
default interval time of 10 seconds is used.
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-count\~\fICOUNT\fP
Specifies the number of reports that are generated at \fIINTERVAL\fP seconds
apart. If this option is omitted, the \fBzcryptstats\fP command generates
reports continuously, until it is stopped with control-C.
.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-output\~\fIJSON\fP|\fITABLE\fP|\fICSV\fP
Displays the statistics in the specified format. If this option is omitted, a
comprehensive report is displayed. Supported output formats are:
.RS 8
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBJSON:\fP Displays the statistics in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format.
JSON output field order is undefined, and new fields might be added in the
future.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBTABLE:\fP Displays the statistics in a human readable simple table format.
The individual counters are omitted, and only the totals are displayed.
This output format implies option \fB\-\-only\-totals\fP.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBCSV:\fP Displays the statistics in comma-separated values format. The values
are separated with a semicolon. The individual counters are omitted, and only
the totals are displayed. This output format implies option
\fB\-\-only\-totals\fP.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-no\-totals
Excludes the totals of all counters of a card device or queue device
(APQN). This option cannot be specified together with option
\fB\-\-only\-totals\fP or option \fB\-\-output\fP \fITABLE\fP|\fICSV\fP.
.
.TP
.BR \-T ", " \-\-only\-totals
Displays only the totals of all counters of a card device or a queue device
(APQN), but not the individual counters. This option is implied with
option \fB\-\-output\fP \fITABLE\fP|\fICSV\fP.
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-no\-apqn
Displays only the counters of the card device, but omits the counters of the
queue device (APQN). If the system does not support obtaining cryptographic
performance measurement data on the queue devices, this option is implied.
.
.TP
.BR \-M ", " \-\-map\-type\~\fIMAPPING\fP
Maps unknown cryptographic device types and modes to known types and modes.
This option should only be used when new, so far unknown cryptographic devices
are found. You can then map them to known devices and modes, provided that the
new cryptographic devices report the same counters as the known cryptographic
device to which it is mapped.
The mapping specification consists of a comma-separated list of
\fIFROM\-TYPE\fP:\fIFROM\-MODE\fP=\fITO\-TYPE\fP:\fITO\-MODE\fP specifications.
The type and mode values must be specified in decimal notation.
.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " \-\-all
Displays all cards devices and queue devices (APQNs), not only those that are
available to the Linux instance. Using this option additional cryptographic
devices that are available in the CEC, but not available to the Linux system
are also monitored.
This option cannot be specified together with option \fB\-\-only\-online\fP.
.
.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\-only\-online
Displays only online cards devices and queue devices (APQNs). This option
cannot be specified together with option \fB\-\-all\fP.
.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-verbose
Displays additional information messages during processing.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Displays help text and exits.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Displays version information and exits.
